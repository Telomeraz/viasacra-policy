# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 14/01/2026

ViaSacra ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application ("ViaSacra") handles information.

## Information We Collect
ViaSacra does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

The app may use third-party services such as map providers (Apple Maps or Google Maps) to display locations. These services may collect information according to their own privacy policies.

## Location Information
ViaSacra does not track your location. If you choose to open a location in an external maps app, that interaction is handled by the maps provider.

## Third-Party Services
ViaSacra may include links to external websites, books, or articles. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties.

## Data Storage
All content is displayed within the app. No user accounts or personal data are stored on our servers.

## Children’s Privacy
ViaSacra does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.
